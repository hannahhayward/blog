A function declaration is when you name the function, followed by the definition. An expression defines an anonymous function, and an arrow function is simply a shorter syntax. When using an expression or arrow function, the definition cannot be used before defined, as they are not hoisted. When writing a function, a parameter and argument is always needed. A parameter is simply the name created for the function, while an argument is the values that the function receives. In some cases, a function can call another function as a parameter or returns a function.
