Planning leads to less errors and helps to create a stronger idea of what your code will be needing in terms of layout and functionalbility. Your other friend, Google, can help you in multiple ways. It could be learning a new technique or finding an answer to a problem you've been struggling with. While you may not always find the answer you were looking for, you can use the information found to help count out causes of your issue. When coding, some key things to remember is that readability is the utmost important thing when writing your code. First; keep an eye out for indentation, capitalization and long lining. There is also such a thing as too much conditional code. Second; fail early and fail often. Use that doubt and those questions to evaluate if you're taking the best approach to your code. Third; push your commits often, instead of just once all at the end. This creates an easier way to track the changes/improvements made to your code. Finally; give you and your brain breaks. Sometimes all you need to solve that code you're struggling with is a fresh pair of eyes.")])]),this._v(" "),t("p",[this._v("Lab Project: https://github.com/hannahhayward/fighting-game")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
